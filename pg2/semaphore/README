============= Build Instructions ============
run make
`make`

This will build two executables: semaphore_server and semaphore_client

============= Run Instructions =============
You should run the semaphore server first 
`semaphore_server <server_id> <initial semaphore count> <duration in seconds> [<client_id> .... <client_id>]`

example 
`semaphore_server 561 0 30 562 563 564 565`


Once the server is running, it will wait until all child processes have been started
To start a child process run the semaphore_client
`semaphore_client <client_id>`

example
`semaphore_client 562`


Once all clients are running, you will start seeing output until the duration time has passed and then each process will terminate.
